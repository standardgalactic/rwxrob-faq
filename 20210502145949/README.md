# Why `lynx` and not `w3m` for text Web browsing?

Both are great and I generally recommend beginners use `w3m` to get
started easily. But `lynx` provides customizations and functionality
that I prefer as well as a better use of white-space when laying out
rendered Web pages. In short, `w3m` is easier and faster to use for a
beginner, but `lynx` is far more powerful when properly customized but
is nearly useless with the default configuration.

By the way, all the other text-based browsers are absolute, complete
shit. Stay far away from them. (If you want details ask about any one in
particular and I'll add the reasons why for that specific one. I'd
rather not even mention them to beginners.)
