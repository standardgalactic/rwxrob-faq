# How do you get large color font title on terminal?

All the fonts that I use are in a separate [repo].com/rwxrob/fonts). The
figlet fonts I've collected over the years are all under `figlet`. I
just combine the `figlet` and `lolcat` command to get the result you see
in these scripts:

[repo]: <https://github.com/rwxrob/fonts> 

* [`figl`](https://github.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/figl)
* [`back`](https://github.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/back)

The main figlet font I use is `future`.
