# Why is your camera and/or mic off?

There's generally two modes when I stream:

1. Quiet Coding and Work
2. Interactive Beginner Boost

The first never has a cam and usually does not have a mic, just chat. In fact,
most of the time I'm not even sitting at my computer, but on a laptop TMUX-ed
into the streaming machine. (Which is why sometimes my typing does not show on
screen and other times it does). I generally do not respond to questions during
this time.

The second is obvious and marked BOOST on the calendar. I'll always have my mic
and camera on and be responding as quickly as I can to questions (some of which
I'll immediately make a video/highlight about). This is the preferred time to
ask your questions.
