# How do you get that large font on terminal?

All the fonts that I use are in a [separate
repo](https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/fonts). The figlet fonts I've collected
over the years are all under `figlet`. I just combine the `figlet` and
`lolcat` command to get the result you see in these scripts:

* [figl](https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/figl)
* [back](https://gitlab.com/rwxrob/dotfiles/-/blob/master/scripts/back)

The main figlet font I use is `future`.
