# What's your hardware/software setup?

Here's my hardware and software applications that I rely on:

* PopOS!
    * Gets out of the way so I can get stuff done
    * No desire to futz with OS, been there, done that
    * Rock solid
    * It just works
    * `apt`
* Gnome-Terminal
    * Alacritty proved too buggy, but otherwise was nice
* Bash Shell
    * Universal, powerful
    * Tab completion
    * `$CDPATH`
    * Exported functions
* TMUX 
    * Configured for `screen` finger-memory
    * Nested TMUX session
        * Two different sockets
    * Main session 
* Vim
    * Neovim is buggy and unnecessary
    * Prefer TMUX for panes to Vim panes
    * Best-in-class macros and shell integration
    * Blows the doors off VSCode for *most* things
    * Ubiquitous unlike Emacs
* WeeChat IRC to Twitch (not WeChat)
    * FIFO for comms.
